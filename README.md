## Overview

PeaversDynamicStats is a World of Warcraft addon that provides visual bars representing your primary and secondary stats.
These bars dynamically update during combat letting you know exactly if you're about to do huge damage.

## Features

- **Real-time Primary Stat Tracking**: Visualizes your character's strength, agility, intellect, and stamina as percentage increases from base values with customizable bars that update in real-time.
- **Real-time Secondary Stat Tracking**: Visualizes your character's haste, critical strike, mastery, and versatility percentages with customizable bars that update in real-time.
- **Stat History Tracking**: Records how your stats change over time and displays historical data in tooltips, including minimum, maximum, average values, and overall change.
- **Combat-Aware Updates**: Increases update frequency during combat for more precise stat monitoring when it matters most.
- **Highly Customizable Interface**: Adjust bar colors, textures, spacing, height, width, and background opacity to match your UI preferences.
- **Movable and Lockable Frame**: Position the stats display anywhere on your screen and lock it in place to prevent accidental movement.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient design with minimal CPU usage, only updating bars when stat values actually change.
- **Show/Hide Individual Stats**: Choose which secondary stats to display based on your preferences and class needs.
- **Combat-Only Mode**: Option to automatically hide the addon when out of combat and show it during combat.
